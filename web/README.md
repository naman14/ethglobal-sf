# Wagmi

A basic react application ([create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)) that shows how to use [Wagmi.sh](https://wagmi.sh/) with Unlock:

- deploying a lock (check [DeployLock.js](./src/DeployLock.js))
- purchase/mint NFT membership (check [PurchaseKey.js](./src/PurchaseKey.js))

You can run locally with `yarn && yarn start` and you can test it on [Vercel](https://examples-wagmi.vercel.app/).
